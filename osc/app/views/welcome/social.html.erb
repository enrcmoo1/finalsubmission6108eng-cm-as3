        <h4>Club AGM, Oval Sports Centre - Sunday 14th July 2013, at 5.00pm</h4>

        Would you like your say on how your ski club is run; do you have any suggestions or questions relating to the skiing sessions, training, teaching, holidays, racing or social events that you would like to share with us? Well this is your big chance. The Oval Ski Club's annual general meeting is taking place on the 14th July at the Oval Sports Centre Meeting room (within the sports centre) at 5pm.<br>
        <br>
        If that was not incentive enough, the club will also be providing free refreshments! (drinks and snacks). <br>
        <br>
        Remember the club is run entirely by volunteers without whom none of the above activities would take place. Further volunteers at Oval Ski Club are very much in demand, so if you can spare a few hours making drinks on a Saturday morning or would like to be Chairman (or any of the jobs in between) - feel free to express your interest and get in touch with us via the <a href="contact"> contact</a> webpage.<br> 
        <br>
        All committee posts will be up for election. If you interested in attending or would like more information please <a href="contact">contact</a> Jane by either phone or email.
